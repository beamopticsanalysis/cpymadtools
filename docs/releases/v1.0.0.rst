.. _release_1.0.0:

1.0.0
-----

Release `1.0.0` is the first release of `cpymadtools`, as an extracted package from `~pyhdtoolkit`.

Some small changes have been applied to the API, with also a few deletions, from `~pyhdtoolkit` version `1.0.0`.
In the future, `pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools` will act as more of an experimental site for the development of this package,
but relative feature parity remains a target.

See `v1.0.0 release notes on GitHub <https://github.com/fsoubelet/cpymadtools/releases/tag/1.0.0>`_.
