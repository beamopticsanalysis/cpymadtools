.. _release_1.1.0:

1.1.0
-----

Release `1.1.0` brings some maintenance improvements and a few bug fixes.
It has API parity with the `pyhdtoolkit.cpymadtools` for version `1.1.0` of `pyhdtoolkit`.
Refer to the `pyhdtoolkit` documentation gallery for examples.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* The `~cpymadtools.lhc.prepare_lhc_run2` function now properly calls the found sequence file.
* The `~cpymadtools.utils.get_table_tfs` function now avoids using the `.dframe()` method of tables and converts them to a dict, then to a DataFrame to export. The previous implementation would sometimes crash on certain element names, or in cases of sliced sequences.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `~cpymadtools.lhc.do_kmodulation` function now accepts ``kwargs`` that will be passed down to the ``TWISS`` call.

Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `~cpymadtools.lhc` module has been split up into many smaller *private* modules. The functionality of the APIs is unchanged, and they are still exposed at the `~cpymadtools.lhc` level.
